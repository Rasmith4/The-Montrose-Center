                <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>The Montrose Center opened in 1978 as Montrose Counseling Center (MCC), after the widely successful Town Meeting I at the Astro Arena.

The Center faced many financial burdens in its formative years, particularly because of the high cost of providing health insurance for its employees living with HIV/AIDS. In the 1990s the Center became one of the first places in Houston to offer temporary housing to gay men and transgender people. In 2013, the Center changed its name from Montrose Counseling Center to the Montrose Center, as services had evolved beyond just counseling and wanted people to feel they could come to the Center for services other than mental health.

Today, the Montrose Center serves as a community hub, with a long, proud history of empowering LGBTQ Houston since 1978.</p>
